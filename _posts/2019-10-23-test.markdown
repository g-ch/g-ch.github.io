This work is to realize fast obstalce avoidance for a quadrotor in an environment with potential dynamic obstacles. The quadrotor is mounted with an active stereo vision system, which is a head composed of a high-resolution servo motor and a RealSense stereo camera. The rotation of the head is planned by a multi-objective planner to have  observations on global target direction, current velocity direction and particularly dynamic obstacles. Then a local map is built with point cloud and sample-based planning algorithm for the quadrotor is utilized to realize fast omnidirectional obstacle avoidance without any movement on Yaw axis. This project is currently under research and a video of preliminary experiment is given below.
