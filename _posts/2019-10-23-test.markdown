&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This work is to realize fast omnidirectional obstacle avoidance for a quadrotor in an environment with potential dynamic obstacles. The quadrotor is mounted with an active stereo vision system, which is a head composed of a high-resolution servo motor and a RealSense stereo camera. The rotation of the head is planned by a multi-objective planner to have  observations on global target direction, current velocity direction and particularly dynamic obstacles. Then a local map is built with point cloud and sample-based planning algorithm for the quadrotor is utilized to realize omnidirectional obstacle avoidance without any movement on Yaw axis.     
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This project mainly concerns local planning and belongs to our navigation framework. More tests need to be conducted to improve the performance. A video of preliminary experiment is given above.
