&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The target of Section 1 is to let the drone fly through some circles and land and re-take off on parking aprons in the order given by the numbers on the aprons. The target of Section 2 is to search for several targets in a indoor environment. We won the champion in both sections. Gang Chen worked as the team leader.
