                        <p class="abstract">Abstract: Particle-based dynamic occupancy maps were proposed in recent years to model the obstacles in dynamic environments. Current particle-based maps describe the occupancy status
                            in discrete grid form and suffer from the grid size problem, wherein
                            a large grid size is unfavorable for motion planning while a small
                            grid size lowers efficiency and causes gaps and inconsistencies. To
                            tackle this problem, this article generalizes the particle-based map
                            into continuous space and builds an efficient 3-D egocentric local
                            map. A dual-structure subspace division paradigm, composed of a
                            voxel subspace division and a novel pyramid-like subspace division,
                            is proposed to propagate particles and update the map efficiently
                            with the consideration of occlusions. The occupancy status at an
                            arbitrary point in the map space can then be estimated with the
                            weights of the particles. To reduce the noise in modeling static
                            and dynamic obstacles simultaneously, an initial velocity estimation approach and a mixture model are utilized. Experimental
                            results show that our map can effectively and efficiently model
                            both dynamic obstacles and static obstacles. Compared to the
                            state-of-the-art grid-form particle-based map, our map enables
                            continuous occupancy estimation and substantially improves the
                            mapping performance at different resolutions.</p>

                            (MAVs) in dynamic and unknown environments is a complex and
                            challenging task. Current works rely on assumptions to solve the
                            problem. The MAV’s pose is precisely known, the dynamic obstacles can be explicitly segmented from static ones, their number is
                            known and fixed, or they can be modeled with given shapes. In
                            this letter, we present a method for MAV navigation in dynamic
                            uncertain environments without making any of these assumptions.
                            The method employs a particle-based dynamic map to represent the
                            local environment and predicts it to the near future. Collision risk
                            is defined based on the predicted maps and a series of risk-aware
                            spatio-temporal (RAST) safety corridors are constructed, which
                            are finally used to optimize a dynamically-feasible collision-free
                            trajectory for the MAV. We compared our method with several
                            state-of-the-art works in 12000 simulation tests in Gazebo with the
                            physical engine enabled. The results show that our method has
                            the highest success rate at different uncertainty levels. Finally, we
                            validated the proposed method in real experiments.</p>

                        <p class="abstract">Abstract: This article investigates a novel activesensing-based obstacle avoidance paradigm for flying
                            robots in dynamic environments. Instead of fusing multiple sensors to enlarge the field of view (FOV), we introduce an alternative approach that utilizes a stereo camera
                            with an independent rotational degree of freedom to sense
                            the obstacles actively. In particular, the sensing direction
                            is planned heuristically by multiple objectives, including
                            tracking dynamic obstacles, observing the heading direction, and exploring the previously unseen area. With the
                            sensing result, a flight path is then planned based on realtime sampling and uncertainty-aware collision checking in
                            the state space, which constitutes an active sense and
                            avoid system. Experiments in both simulation and the real
                            world demonstrate that this system can well cope with dynamic obstacles and abrupt goal direction changes. Since
                            only one stereo camera is utilized, this system provides
                            a low-cost and effective approach to overcome the FOV
                            limitation in visual navigation.</p>

                        <p class="abstract">Abstract: Quadrotor with active sensing was proposed recently
                            to overcome the view field limitation and achieved an excellent
                            perception ability in obstacle avoidance tasks. To realize high-speed
                            flights of this quadrotor in unknown and cluttered environments,
                            a computationally efficient trajectory planner is presented in this
                            letter. Firstly, a non-taboo area gradient-based sampling (NAGS)
                            algorithm is utilized to sample a multi-objective-directed collisionfree local path. The algorithm runs in the state space with the
                            consideration of active sensing direction and is able to find a feasible
                            path in a few trials without falling into local minima. To further
                            enhance real-time processing, a motion primitive generation algorithm concerning both time optimality and jerk optimality is
                            raised, in which an offline and online integrated solver is utilized to
                            achieve computational efficiency. This planner is tested and benchmarked against the state-of-the-art planners for high-speed flight.
                            Real-world experiments show that our active sensing quadrotor
                            with the proposed planner achieved a flight speed up to 5.2 m/s
                            in an unknown and dense woods and managed to handle abrupt
                            changes in goal direction at such a high speed.</p>
