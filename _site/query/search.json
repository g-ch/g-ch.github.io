    ,"content"  : "A new paper, titled RAST: Risk-Aware Spatio-Temporal Safety Corridors for MAV Navigation in Dynamic Uncertain Environments, is accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9998074. Brief Introduction: Autonomous navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in dynamic and unknown environments is a complex and challenging task. Current works rely on assumptions to solve the problem. The MAV’s pose is precisely known, the dynamic obstacles can be explicitly segmented from static ones, their number is known and fixed, or they can be modeled with given shapes. In this letter, we present a method for MAV navigation in dynamic uncertain environments without making any of these assumptions. The method employs a particle-based dynamic map to represent the local environment and predicts it to the near future. Collision risk is defined based on the predicted maps and a series of risk-aware spatio-temporal (RAST) safety corridors are constructed, which are finally used to optimize a dynamically-feasible collision-free trajectory for the MAV. We compared our method with several state-of-the-art works in 12000 simulation tests in Gazebo with the physical engine enabled. The results show that our method has the highest success rate at different uncertainty levels. Finally, we validated the proposed method in real experiments."

    ,"content"  : "Brief Introduction: This work aims to plan risk-aware trajectories for MAVs in dynamic environments efficiently. The risk is to evaluate the trajectory’s safety, considering the time dimention, and is defined for each trajectory by leveraging the particles in our DSP map. The MAV with our planner can fly up to 2.5 m/s in the environment with both static obstalces and dynamc obstacles. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the firstquadrotor obstacle avoidance system that can avoid arbitrary-shaped dynamic and static obstacles simultaneously. The contributions of this paper include: An efficient risk-aware sampling approach composedof two-phase motion primitives in the state space. The approach to merge the local trajectory given byour planner to an arbitrary global trajectory. A complete obstacle avoidance system that can beapplied to light-weight quadrotors in dynamic environ-ments.

    ,"content"  : "Brief Introduction: This map is designed to efficiently represent the environment with both static and dynamic obstacles. Only point cloud and odometry are required to build the map. The theoretical basis is the random finite set and PHD filter. With particles updated with a special dual-structure (pyramid structure and voxel structure) pipeline, the map can derive current and future occupancy status in continuous form and uncertainty can be represented. Thus it can be used to realize obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,this is the first continuous particle-based occupancy map andthe first dynamic occupancy map that can be applied to small-scale robotic systems like quadrotors.The main contributions of this work include four points: A novel dual-structure particle-based map buildingparadigm that enables continuous mapping of the oc-cupancy status of dynamic environments. The leverage of initial velocity estimation and an effi-cient mixture model to reduce noise in modeling static and dynamic obstacles simultaneously. The complete procedures of building a DSP map thatcan be applied to onboard computing devices of small-scale robotic systems.

We want to realize high-speed obstacle avoidance of the quadrotor with very limited sensing and computing power. Our methods include two main parts: 1. A Dual-Structure Particle-based (DSP) map, which can represent and predict the occupancy status of the neighborhood area continuously and rapidly. This is the first 3D dynamic occupancy map that can be used in onboard CPUs in real-time. 2. A risk-aware sampling-based trajectory planning method, which is used to plan a safe and dynamically feasible trajectory for quadrotors in dynamic environments.

To realize high-speed flights of this quadrotor in unknown and cluttered environments, a computationally efficient trajectory planner is presented in this paper. Firstly, a non-taboo area gradient-based sampling (NAGS) algorithm is utilized to sample a multi-objective-directed collision-free local path. The algorithm runs in the state space with the consideration of active sensing direction and is able to find a feasible path in a few trials without falling into local minima. To further enhance real-time processing, a motion primitive generation algorithm concerning both time optimality and jerk optimality is raised, in which an offline and online integrated solver is utilized to achieve computational efficiency. This planner is tested and benchmarked against the state-of-the-art planners for high-speed flight. Real-world experiments show that our active sensing quadrotor with the proposed planner achieved a flight speed up to 5.2 m/s in an unknown and dense woods and managed to handle abrupt changes in goal direction at such a high speed."

In particular, the rotation is planned heuristically by multiple objectives that can benefit flight safety, including tracking dynamic obstacles, observing the heading direction, and exploring the previously unseen area. With this sensing result, a flight path is planned based on real-time sampling and collision checking in state space, which constitutes an active sense and avoid (ASAA) system.      This is the first system that applies active stereo vision to realize obstacle avoidance for flying robots."

A visual information pyramid (VIP) model and three criteria for a proper representation is proposed. Then we presents our representation composed of a depth image with particular noise model and a categorized detection image to adjust sim-to-real learning-based navigation in environment with both static and dynamic obstacles. To evaluate the effectiveness, we firstly built a coarse simulation environment in Gazebo and collected a one-hour-long dataset from expert’s operation. Then we trained eight models with our representation and other representations popularly used in the literature, such as RGB image, depth image and segmented semantic image. The model trained with our representation stands out in both simulation and real world tests. Further more, we analyzed the inner reaction of the network models to given further comparison."
