    ,"content"  : "Brief Introduction:      Obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments is very popular recently. We aim to realize high-speed obstacle avoidance of the quadrotor with very limited sensing and computing power. Our methods include two main parts: 1. A Dual-Structure Particle-based (DSP) map, which can represent and predict the occupancy status of the neighborhood area continuously and rapidly. This is the first 3D dynamic occupancy map that can be used in onboard CPUs in real-time. 2. A risk-aware sampling-based trajectory planning method, which is used to plan a safe and dynamically feasible trajectory for quadrotors in dynamic environments. See the figure above for preliminary experiments."

Ding, Learning to Navigate from Simulation via Spatial and Semantic Information Synthesis, in Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05758 Brief Introduction:     This work systematically investigates environment representations for visual navigation through sim-to-real transfer learning. A visual information pyramid (VIP) model and three criteria for a proper representation is proposed. Then we presents our representation composed of a depth image with particular noise model and a categorized detection image to adjust sim-to-real learning-based navigation in environment with both static and dynamic obstacles. To evaluate the effectiveness, we firstly built a coarse simulation environment in Gazebo and collected a one-hour-long dataset from expert’s operation. Then we trained eight models with our representation and other representations popularly used in the literature, such as RGB image, depth image and segmented semantic image. The model trained with our representation stands out in both simulation and real world tests. Further more, we analyzed the inner reaction of the network models to given further comparison."
